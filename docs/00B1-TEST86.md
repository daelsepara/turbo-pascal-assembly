# Test for 8086/80186/80286

Checks CPU type based on whether or not the upper bits of the flags are over-written.

```nasm
SYS00B1: 33C0          XOR	AX,AX
```

**AX** = 0, processor is at least an **[8086](DATA.md)**

```nasm
SYS00B3: 9C            PUSHF
SYS00B4: 5B            POP	BX
SYS00B5: 80E70F        AND	BH,0F
SYS00B8: 53            PUSH	BX
SYS00B9: 9D            POPF
SYS00BA: 9C            PUSHF
SYS00BB: 59            POP	CX
SYS00BC: 80E5F0        AND	CH,F0
SYS00BF: 80FDF0        CMP	CH,F0
SYS00C2: 740E          JZ	00D2
```

Determine processor based on the flag bits

```nasm
SYS00C4: 40            INC	AX
```

Processor type is at least an **[80286](DATA.md)**.

```nasm
SYS00C5: 80CFF0        OR	BH,F0
SYS00C8: 53            PUSH	BX
SYS00C9: 9D            POPF
SYS00CA: 9C            PUSHF
SYS00CB: 59            POP	CX
SYS00CC: 80E5F0        AND	CH,F0
SYS00CF: 7401          JZ	00D2
```

Test the flags again if they are overwritten.

```nasm
SYS00D1: 40            INC	AX
```

Processor type is at least a **[80386](DATA.md)**.

```nasm
SYS00D2: A24C00        MOV	[Test8086],AL
SYS00D5: C3            RET
```

Store result in **[Test8086](DATA.md)** then return to caller. Because it is a **NEAR RET**, it can only be called from within the system library.
