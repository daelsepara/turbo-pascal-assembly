# Test for 8086/80186/80286

Checks CPU type based on whether or not the upper bits of the flags are over-written.

```nasm
SYS00B1: XOR AX,AX
```

**AX** = 0, processor is at least an **[8086](DATA.md)**

```nasm
SYS00B3: PUSHF
SYS00B4: POP BX
SYS00B5: AND BH,0F
SYS00B8: PUSH BX
SYS00B9: POPF
SYS00BA: PUSHF
SYS00BB: POP CX
SYS00BC: AND CH,F0
SYS00BF: CMP CH,F0
SYS00C2: JZ 00D2
```

Determine processor based on the flag bits

```nasm
SYS00C4: INC AX
```

Processor type is at least an **[80286](DATA.md)**.

```nasm
SYS00C5: OR BH,F0
SYS00C8: PUSH BX
SYS00C9: POPF
SYS00CA: PUSHF
SYS00CB: POP CX
SYS00CC: AND CH,F0
SYS00CF: JZ 00D2
```

Test the flags again if they are overwritten.

```nasm
SYS00D1: INC AX
```

Processor type is at least a **[80386](DATA.md)**.

```nasm
SYS00D2: MOV [Test8086],AL
SYS00D5: RET
```

Store result in **[Test8086](DATA.md)** then return to caller. Because it is a **NEAR RET**, it can only be called from within the system library.
